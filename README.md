# File Comparer

Your task is to implement a file comparer which takes a path to a directory and finds all binary duplicates.
The implementation should output which files that had duplicates and the file names of the duplicate files.
You should also implement persistance of the data so that it is possible to find duplicates in folders 
that has previously been scanned.

The task is designed to not take more than 4 hours. To use internet to solve your problem is encouraged but 
keep in mind that you will be asked to explain your implementation. The discussion around the code is more 
important than the code itself.

The implementation should be written in C# for .NET Core and the solution should include tests.

Happy Programming!
